<h1>Program history</h1>

<p>Spider in its latest version is numbered V6. For a good few years, the program ran successfully as version 5, which already supported cutting-edge Web technologies like HTML5 and CSS3 at the time of its creation. In the few years since the release of its last version, there has been a real revolution in web technologies, especially the rise of mobile devices that now drive the world. Unfortunately, in this changing environment Pajczek became a bit mossy, and the work on version 6 dragged on mercilessly, when in the face of changes in personal life and the technological explosion, the assumptions made turned out to be too ambitious for one person who creates the program. Me. Sorry.</p>

<p>I decided that I didn't want to condemn my life's work to oblivion, however, and refresh it a bit by adding support for new technologies and adapting it at least a little to the changes that have occurred. As a result, V6 is more of an evolution than a revolution. It is now simply a good tool for everyday work with code. I personally have been using it for years not only as a page editor, but I have also managed to create several Android and iOS apps in it that have gained relative popularity and help people in their lives or work. I have also built these features into V6 so that others can benefit from my experience as well.</p>

<p>Many people brought up on Spider 5 and earlier versions, have left for other jobs, or moved on to other tools, imposed by employers or the changing market. However, I hope that the current issue will interest you not only as a curiosity from the past, but also something useful in the daily work of a front- or backend coder. I also dream that young webmasters and coders and aspiring coders will be interested in it at least enough to enter the world of coding with its help.</p>

<p>Spider has evolved from a simple page generator running in DOS character mode to its current form as a program supporting the latest technologies used on the Web.</p>
<p>Below you can see an abbreviated version history of the program in order from newest to oldest version.</p>

<h2>Spider V6</h2>

<p>The premiere of the program takes place in 2021, 25 years after the premiere of the first version for DOS. The program is now a quarter of a century old. This is unbelievable ... <a href="info_whatsnew.php"> What's new? </a></p>

<h2>Spider 5.x</h2>

<p>In 2003, after a year and a half break from the last version of Spider 2000 (subversion 4.8.1), the eagerly awaited by users Spider 5.0 is released, the latest version 5.9.9 being released in April 2013. In the fifth version there was a division into two lines of the program:</p>
<ul>
        <li><b>Professional</b> - full version program designed for professionals. It supports advanced technologies, is richly equipped with tools to support work in different programming languages, group work, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Standard</b> - does not have many advanced tools. However, it is fully sufficient to prepare even quite advanced websites based on DHTML.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the profound changes that have taken place in the program, we have put a lot of effort into making sure that people using Spider 2000 can start working in the new version of the program without much trouble.</p>

<p>The first, most striking change was of course the new program interface. It was possible to customize the appearance of the program to an unprecedented extent.</p>

<p>New tabbed panels have been added to the right and bottom of the program. They contain powerful new tools. The FTP client (the "Publishing" tab known from Spider 2000) is now located on the right panel and is called "Servers".</p>

<p>The layout and content of the main menu and toolbars have changed and are now much more helpful when working. You will intuitively find all tools exactly where you should expect them. Each command has its own icon, which makes it much easier to find the needed tool among a wide range of other commands.</p>

<h2>Spider 2000 4.x</h2>

<p>Spider 2000 was developed from October 27, 1998, when version 4.0 was released, over a period of about 2.5 years. During this period a total of 12 updates were released. The last one, Spider 2000 4.8.1, was released on April 12, 2001.</p>

<p>Over the course of the program's evolution, numerous features have been added, additional facilities introduced, numerous syntax highlighting schemes added, etc.</p>

<!-- nag&#322;owek podtematu -->
<h2>Spider 3.0 Light</h2>

<p>October 19, 1998 <br>
 This is a renewed version of the website generator (version 1.11 and 1.12). This time, significantly expanded, among others o FTP publishing options.</p>

<!-- nag&#322;owek podtematu -->
<h2>Spider 2.x</h2>

<p>Spider 2 would have been just a continuation of version 1.x. However, on October 19, 1998 the system crashed, and the source codes of the almost finished version were lost. This event motivated me to redefine the assumptions of the program and to restart work on version 2.0, but this time it was completely different.</p>

<p>The release of Spider 2.0 for Windows 3.x/95/NT took place on May 9, 1997. It was updated to version 2.1.2 on August 10, 1997.</p>

<!-- nag&#322;owek podtematu -->
<h2>Spider 1.x</h2>

<p><b>November 10, 1996 - Spider 1.11 and Spider 1.12</b><br>
These were basically the same programs, however, running under Windows 3.x and Windows 95/NT, respectively. These versions are still available for download from our online archive.</p>

<p><b>August 28, 1996 - Spider 1.0 for Windows 3.x</b><br>
The first version of Spider for Windows. At this stage, Spider was a simple web page generator working on a similar principle as the DOS version, but with a mouse-operated graphical user interface.</p>

<p><b>April 4, 1996 - Spider for DOS and Linux</b><br>
A simple program that generates web pages based on answers to questions. This version worked under DOS or Linux in character mode. It was created in C language as a semester work for the Computer Science and Econometrics Department of Cracow University of Economics (now University of Economics).<!-- tre&#347;&#263; pomocy -->
